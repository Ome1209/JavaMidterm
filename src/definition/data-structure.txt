***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer:Java programmers use data structures to store and organize data,

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer:The most common ones are Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:To implement back functionality in the internet browser.

What is an Array?
Answer:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.
Therefore, array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them

What is a LinkedList?
Answer:A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address.

What is a Queue?
Answer:Queue represents a data structure designed to have elements
inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer:Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer:FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where
the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last and
LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as first in, last out (FILO).

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer:Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an
algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer:The most common algorithm to search an element in an unsorted array is using a linear search,
checking element by element from the beginning to the end, this algorithm takes O(n) complexity.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer:The worst case complexity is O(n/2) (equivalent to O(n)) when element is in the middle or not present in
the array. The best case complexity is O(1) when element is first or last element in the array.
